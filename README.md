# IMDb Sentiment Analysis Using RNNs

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for sentiment analysis of movie reviews from IMDb. Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that determines the emotional tone behind a body of text. This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture sequential dependencies and contextual nuances in text data, making them ideal for processing and analyzing natural language.

## Objectives

- To build and train a deep learning model capable of performing sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews.
- To utilize RNN architectures to understand and classify the sentiment of the text as either positive or negative.
- To achieve a high level of accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative reviews, thereby demonstrating the model's understanding of complex language patterns and sentiments.

## Methodology

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are a class of neural networks designed for handling sequential data. They are particularly effective in natural language processing tasks because of their ability to maintain state or memory across the input sequence, capturing the context and dependencies of words in a sentence.

### Data Source

The dataset comprises movie reviews from IMDb, tagged with corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). This dataset is commonly used in sentiment analysis research and serves as a benchmark for evaluating model performance.
